# Code-Refactoring
This is the assignment for Week 1&2. 
Excercise was to refactor the existing code as per acceptance criteria:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Changes include:
- update to css stylesheet link
- update to images link and added alt attributes
- added comments to both files
- consolidated some of the class styles
- added responsive link when user clicks on the menu to navigate to the correct section within page
- hide footer
